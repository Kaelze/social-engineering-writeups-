OBJECTIVE

The objective of this exercise is to identify phishing indicators in a Christmas-themed email and understand how attackers manipulate users into clicking malicious links.

KEY OBSERVATION

During the analysis, the phishing email used a cheerful holiday theme to lower the victim’s guard. Festive language and attractive offers were used to create excitement, making the message seem harmless at first glance. However, closer inspection revealed several suspicious elements that clearly indicate a phishing attempt.

PHISHING INDICATORS IDENTIFIED

Some of the red flags observed in this exercise include:

- A suspicious sender email address that does not match a legitimate organization

- Urgent call-to-action encouraging users to click quickly

- Embedded links redirecting to unknown or untrusted websites

- Festive and emotional language used to manipulate user behavior

- Example of user gets trapped and enters their credentials. As you can see, we can see the user's username and password.

ANALYSIS

This exercise highlights how attackers take advantage of holidays when users are more relaxed and less cautious. Even emails that look friendly and well-designed can be dangerous. Users should always verify links and sender details before interacting with any email content.

CONCLUSION

In conclusion, Phishing – Merry Clickmas demonstrates how effective social engineering can be when combined with emotional manipulation. This exercise reinforced the importance of being vigilant, especially during festive seasons, and always validating emails before clicking links or sharing information.
