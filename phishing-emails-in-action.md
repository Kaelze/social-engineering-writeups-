#PHISHING EMAILS IN ACTION (TryHackMe)

##INTRODUCTION

Email phishing remains one of the most common attack vectors in cybersecurity. In the Phishing Emails in Action room, I analyzed real-world phishing email samples to learn how to identify malicious emails based on their content, structure, and behavior.

##OBJECTIVE

The objective of this exercise is to examine phishing emails and identify common characteristics that distinguish them from legitimate emails.


##WHAT I LEARNED

Through this exercise, I learned that phishing emails often impersonate trusted organizations to steal sensitive information. Attackers rely on poor user awareness rather than technical exploits. By carefully analyzing email headers, links, attachments, and wording, phishing attempts can be detected early.


##COMMON PHISHING CHARACTERISTICS OBSERVED

The following indicators were commonly found in the phishing emails analyzed:

- Generic greetings such as “Dear User” instead of personal names

- Grammar and spelling mistakes

- Mismatch between sender name and actual email domain

- Fake login or password reset links

- Suspicious attachments or unexpected files

##DEFENSIVE TECHNIQUES

From this exercise, several defensive practices were identified:

- Always verify the sender’s email address

- Hover over links before clicking

- Avoid opening unknown attachments

- Report suspicious emails to administrators

- Conduct regular phishing awareness training

##CONCLUSION

In conclusion, Phishing Emails in Action provides valuable hands-on experience in recognizing real phishing attempts. This exercise emphasizes that awareness and careful inspection are key defenses against email-based attacks. Understanding these techniques is essential for both individuals and organizations to reduce phishing risks.
